  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># this is the cool bit. serial music operates by driving a sequence of</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># instructions from an initial choice. the initial choice in the classroom</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># example, and in John Cage's original composition experiments, was random;</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># however, there are other ways to do it. here's how get_a_number does it.</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># I did three iterations, basically rendering output each time I got some piece</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># of code working. the first iteration just returned random numbers; the second</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># returned random numbers one out of every three times and arbitrary constants</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># (5 and 23) an equal number of other times. this third time, the number gets</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># popped from one of two continuations, representing either the Fibonacci</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># sequence, or a sequence generated by a Feigenbaum function. output from each</span>
  <span class="ruby-comment cmt"># iteration gets saved as MIDI and imported into Reason (by hand).</span>
