==== About Tuesday ====

Tuesday is a simple media player build in Ruby (Ruby Tuesday :) ) that claims the
absence of playlists as a feature. In its current state, it is very incomplete.

Tuesday is a personal pet project.


==== Running Tuesday ====

Tuesday requires Qt and KDE bindings for Ruby. On Fedora, the pakages are called
'QtRuby' and 'korundum'. Tuesda requires Qt versioun 4.6 or greater.

With these prereqs, you can run Tuesday by navigating to Tuesday/src and running Main.rb
eg:
    cd ~/Tuesday/src
    ./Main.rb

In the future a startup script and a .desktop file will be provided.
